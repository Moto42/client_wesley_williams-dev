      <span class="ffb__function">
        There are two broad categories of web developement. Front-End: the code sent to the browser; and Back-End: the code running on the servers.
        As a 'Full Stack' developer; I am prepared to build both the Front-End code presenting your website to the user, and any server-side code as well.

        This saves the time and expense of hiring and coordinating multiple developers.
