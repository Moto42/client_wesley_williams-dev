This is freelance web development site for Wesley Williams.

## How it's made
This website was built using the Eleventy template engine and the Liquid template language.

The pages are defined by the '.liquid' files in the 'templates' folder. For all practical purposes 'templates' acts as the root of the website, with the live site's directory structure mimicing the one found in the templates folder.

## So where are my .html files?
You should see a folder named '\_site'. Your 'ready for the web' files and folders will be there.
